# Week 3: Manual vs Automation Testing
## Assignment:
**List 5 advantages and 5 disadvantages of automation testing**

---

## ✅ Advantages of Automation Testing

1. **Faster Execution**  
   Automated tests run significantly faster than manual testing, especially for repetitive or large-scale test cases.

2. **Reusability of Test Scripts**  
   Once created, test scripts can be reused across different versions of an application with minimal changes.

3. **Increased Test Coverage**  
   Automation allows more tests to be executed in less time, enabling broader test coverage and catching more bugs.

4. **Accuracy and Consistency**  
   Automated tests perform the same steps precisely every time, reducing the risk of human error.

5. **Cost-Effective in the Long Run**  
   Although the initial setup is costly, automation reduces labor costs and time spent on repetitive testing over the project lifecycle.

## ❌ Disadvantages of Automation Testing

1. **High Initial Investment**  
   Tools, frameworks, and skilled resources required for automation can be expensive initially.

2. **Limited to Predefined Tests**  
   Automation is only effective for scenarios that are predictable and repetitive; it cannot handle ad-hoc or exploratory testing.

3. **Maintenance Overhead**  
   Automated tests require regular updates and maintenance as the application evolves.

4. **Not Suitable for UI Changes**  
   Frequent UI changes can cause automated tests to break, requiring constant updates to the test scripts.

5. **Requires Skilled Testers**  
   Test automation demands knowledge of scripting or programming, which may not be available in all QA teams.
